## Brief Introduction
Wireless sensor networks can basically be defined as the embodiment of different sensors placed at strategic locations and that are specialized to monitor and take measurements of varying environmental conditions and report the data collected to a central hub. Wireless Sensor networks make computations such as evaluating the temperature, measuring sound intensity, detecting emission levels and taking records of humidity and wind.

## WSN and the Internet of things
The internet of things, or IoT, is a network of connected computers, mechanical and digital machinery, as well as other items, living things, and even humans. and the capacity to move data through a network without involving any contact between people or computers. The term "thing" refers to any natural or artificial object that can be given an Internet Protocol (IP) address and has the ability to transfer data over a network, including people with implanted heart monitors, farm animals with biochip transponders, cars with built-in tire pressure monitors, and other examples.  in the case of this project, a thing in the network is each sensor node having the temperature and humidity sensor and by the help of the central node, they are linked to a Wide Area Network WAN. The uniqueness of this node is that they operate locally on their own wireless network, given room for another connectivity.
