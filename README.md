## Brief Introduction
Wireless sensor networks can basically be defined as the embodiment of different sensors placed at strategic locations and that are specialized to monitor and take measurements of varying environmental conditions and report the data collected to a central hub. Wireless Sensor networks make computations such as evaluating the temperature, measuring sound intensity, detecting emission levels and taking records of humidity and wind.
